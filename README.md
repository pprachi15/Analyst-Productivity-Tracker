# 📊 Productivity System for Analyst Workflows (Smartsheet)

This project simulates a real-world task and request tracking system used by analysts, data strategists, and project managers in higher education environments.

It was designed in Smartsheet to mirror the operational workflow of a Business Systems Analyst supporting reporting, stakeholder communication, and day-to-day execution at institutions like UC Davis Continuing and Professional Education.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Smartsheet Grid View**
- **Dropdown lists and conditional formatting**
- **Form View** (for task intake simulation)
- **Formula columns** (e.g., Days to Complete)
- **Reports (for overdue tasks, high priority, weekly output)**

## ⚙️ Key Features

### ✅ Analyst Task Tracker
- Tracks 300+ tasks across multiple categories (SQL, Reporting, Dashboard, Meeting, Ad-hoc)
- Columns include Priority, Status, Start/Due/Complete Dates, and Assigned Owner
- Includes a formula to calculate `Days to Complete` based on task lifecycle

### 🔁 Live Task Intake Form
- Designed using Smartsheet's Form Builder
- Simulates internal task assignment workflow (like ServiceNow or JIRA)
- Submissions automatically populate into the master task sheet

### 🧠 Smart Logic & Formatting
- Conditional formatting rules highlight:
  - 🔴 Overdue tasks
  - 🟢 Completed items
  - 🟡 High-priority tasks
- Built-in filters for "Due Today", "Not Started", "In Progress", etc.

### 📊 Dashboard (Configurable)
- Metric widgets show:
  - Total tasks
  - Tasks completed this week
  - Open high-priority tasks
- Pie and bar charts for:
  - Task distribution by category
  - Status breakdown (In Progress, Complete, Not Started)
- Report widgets highlight:
  - 🔥 Overdue requests
  - Weekly wins

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was built to simulate the kind of structured, analytical, and highly visible system used by higher ed analysts and operational teams. It reflects real task tracking and reporting workflows and highlights process ownership, visibility, and accountability.

## 📈 Outcome

- Created a high-volume, multi-category tracking system to manage and visualize analyst workloads
- Improved task visibility with color-coded logic and live reporting filters
- Enabled executive-style dashboards and team coordination tools using no-code platform features
